@details

TaskManager has a limit of 128 active tasks. An assertion will fail if
any are added when there are no free slots.

If TaskWork has a null func, its task is considered "empty" and no
execution is done for it. Empty tasks can be used to collate sub-tasks
and build task dependencies without incurring extra calls and
synchronization tear down/setup.

If workers are available, they will execute either the next available
task or the next task to be added. As a result, "priority" may not be
fully honored if tasks aren't added in a descending priority order. To
ensure the highest priority tasks are executed first, either setup a
hierarchy with task_manager::add_hold() or add them in descending
priority. Furthermore, lower-priority tasks may be executed before
higher-priority tasks due to preemption.
