If a read operation reaches the end of the stream without reading all
of the requested size, the stream status will have the EOF flag,
indicating only a failure to satisfy the request.

Both read and write operations may set the fail flag on the stream's
status, which indicates an internal failure. Every operation and query
apart from io::status() may clear the status of the stream upon entry.

If a read operation fails (through the EOF or fail flags), the state
of the destination buffer may be indeterminate (specifically, with
system-based streams).

Streams that do not support seeking will set the fail flag and should
return 0 for all position values.
