## What be it?

**togo** is a collection of libraries with data-oriented design at heart.

## Core design

togo is optimization-routed to an extent that is possibly harmful.
Interfaces are kept separate from types to reduce compilation time, and most
data structures are “open” in that they can be modified by anything. It aims
to make friends with the cache through careful data design & utilization.

togo uses the C++ stdlib only minimally. It supplies its own collections and
allocators (in which the stdlib is… lacking) and most other constructs.
If we can write it, we probably do, primarily because the implementation will
then be license-free, consistent, easier to debug, and aligned with togo's
design.

Systems are decoupled for locality, flexibility in storage, and encapsulation.
Systems are easier to understand and *much* easier to maintain when they are
decoupled — i.e., when they have few explicit dependencies on other systems.

## Components

### Library: core

Basic support library. All other libraries depend on it.

Dependencies:

1. [All the Maths‽](https://github.com/komiga/am) (HEAD)

### Library: image

Imaging library.

### Library: window

Windowing library.

Dependencies:

1. Backend (one of):
  1. OpenGL:
    1. [SDL](http://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) >= **2.0.3**
    2. [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/download.html) >= **3.0.4**
  2. Raster:
    1. [XCB (Linux)](http://xcb.freedesktop.org) >= **1.11**

### Library: game

Game engine.

This library takes significant inspiration from [bitsquid](http://bitsquid.se),
who have [written about](https://github.com/niklasfrykholm/blog) their design
in great detail.

Dependencies:

1. [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/index.html) >= **1.11.0**

### Tool: res_build

Resource package compiler for the game library. Interface is available as a
static library for extension/automation.

## Platforms

togo is developed under Linux and currently only supports Linux. Its primary
interface implementations utilize POSIX and the C Standard Library (by way of
the C++ Standard Library, of which only little is used).

## Building

togo libraries are compiled static libraries (by default).

All features support Clang 3.5+ with libc++ (roughly at SVN head) on
Ubuntu 14.04 x86_64. GCC and libstdc++ might possibly work, but they
are untested.

See `dep/README.md` for dependency setup. Libraries, tools, and tests can
then be compiled using plash's standard project protocol:
http://komiga.com/pp-cpp

The only difference from the project protocol is `scripts/premake` in place of
premake, which enforces recipe order to allow the use of GNU make's `--jobs`.
