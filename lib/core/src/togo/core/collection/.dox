@details

Array is currently the only collection that supports the
enable_collection_construction_and_destruction trait. Others will incur a copy
at best, and fail compilation at worst (due to missing ctors or assignment
operators). Other dynamic collections use Array underneath, so any operations
directly using Array will use the appropriate state management.

@warning None of these types are thread-safe.
