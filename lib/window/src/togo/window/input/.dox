Due to the behavior of some backends, there should only be
one InputBuffer in use. Events for windows that have not been added
to the window system will be discarded.

The SDL backend may report events to the wrong window due to
SDL implementation quirks. Keyboard events that do not have a valid
windowID will be reported as having come from the first window in the
input buffer (hopefully the primary window).
