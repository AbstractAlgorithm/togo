Pixmap storage is y-major, starting with the top-left pixel.

Pixel layout names correspond to byte order. For example, PixelLayout::argb
corresponds to:

@code
FF 00 00 00 // A mask
00 FF 00 00 // R mask
00 00 FF 00 // G mask
00 00 00 FF // B mask
@endcode

PixelLayout::rgb with PixelDataType::p32 has the same order as above, with
the MSB being empty (unused):

@code
00 00 00 00 // X mask
00 FF 00 00 // R mask
00 00 FF 00 // G mask
00 00 00 FF // B mask
@endcode

Pixmaps use the default allocator.
